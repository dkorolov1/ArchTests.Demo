# ArchTests.Demo üß±
This solution is a demo project built on the philosophy of Clean Architecture, incorporating DDD and CQRS patterns. It features a simple API with a minimal set of functions for managing Checklist and Requirement entities, where Requirements belong to Checklists. Essentially, it‚Äôs a familiar to-do list with a different label. To keep things straightforward, in-memory repositories are used, so the data only persists for the duration of the API's runtime.

## Run It üèÉ
It has no external dependencies. To run the project, simply execute:

`otnet run --project "src/ArchUnitNET.Demo.Api"`

## Explore It üîé

Swagger is integrated, allowing you to explore all endpoints at `<api_root_url>/swagger`.

### Endpoints

##### Checklists:
Add : `POST:{{host}}/api/checklists`<br/>
Get All : `GET:{{host}}/api/checklists`<br/>
Delete : `DELETE:{{host}}/api/checklists/{{checklistId}}`<br/>
##### Requirements:
Add To Checklist : `POST:{{host}}/api/checklists/{{checklistId}}/requirements`<br/>
Update <u>IsComplied</u> Flag : `PATCH:{{host}}/api/requirements/{{requirementId}}`<br/>

## Play With It üéÆ
The `requests` folder contains examples of all the requests supported by the API. You can try them out directly from VS Code, as shown below.

Ensure you have the [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension installed in VS Code and set the `dev` environment (`Ctrl+Alt+E`  or `Cmd+Alt+E` for macOS).

## Test It üß™

This implementation includes only architectural tests. To run them, execute: `dotnet test`.
